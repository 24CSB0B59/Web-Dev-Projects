            <p style="font-size: medium;">             The City Palace, Jaipur is a magnificent palace complex in the heart of Jaipur, 
             the capital of Rajasthan, India. The palace was constructed by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II 
             at the same time as the foundation of Jaipur, in 1727. The palace complex includes the 
             Chandra Mahal and Mubarak Mahal palaces and other buildings.
                
             The City Palace reflects a perfect blend of Mughal and Rajput architecture. The Chandra 
             Mahal is the most commanding building, and since 2016, the majority of it is now a museum, 
             but it still serves as the royal residence for the descendants of the former rulers of Jaipur.

             The palace complex has several courtyards, gardens, and buildings of different interests. 
             All these structures, gardens, and courtyards add to the grandeur of the palace complex.

            <h3>Architecture</h3>
        <pre>
            <p>    The City Palace, Jaipur exhibits a blend of the traditional Rajput and Mughal architectural 
    styles. The palace complex includes a series of courtyards, gardens, and buildings that have 
    served as the residence of the Maharajas. The key structures in the complex include the 
    Mubarak Mahal, Chandra Mahal, Mukut Mahal, Maharani's Palace, Sri Govind Dev Temple, a 
    museum, and the City Palace Museum.

    The Mubarak Mahal (meaning the 'Auspicious Palace') built with a mix of Islamic, Rajput, and 
    European styles, now serves as a museum showcasing royal costumes, Pashmina shawls, Benaras 
    silk saris, and other artifacts reflecting the regal heritage.

    The Chandra Mahal is one of the key palaces in the complex. It is a seven-storied building, 
    and each floor has been given a specific name such as Sukh-Niwas, Rang-Mandir, 
    Shobha-Niwas, and Mukut Mahal. This part of the palace is still a residence for the 
    descendants of the former royal family of Jaipur, but part of it has been converted into a museum.

    The entire palace complex is a mix of grand courtyards, intricately decorated halls, and attractively 
    manicured gardens that overlook Jaipur and give a stunning view of the Pink City.
