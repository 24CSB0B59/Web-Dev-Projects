            <p style="font-size: medium;">             The Amer Fort is a fort located in Amer, Rajasthan, India. It is known for its artistic 
             style elements that are a mix of Hindu and Rajput styles. The fort overlooks Maota Lake, 
             which is the primary source of water for the Amer Palace.
                
             The fort was built by Raja Man Singh I, a trusted general of the Mughal emperor Akbar. 
             The structure, built with red sandstone and marble, incorporates both Rajput and Mughal
             architectural elements. The fort has four main sections, each with its own courtyard.

             The fort is famous for its artistic Hindu style elements and has large ramparts and series 
             of gates and cobbled paths. The fort overlooks the Maota Lake at its forefront, which is 
             the main source of water for the Amer Palace.

    (Hall of Private Audience), the Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace), and the Sukh Niwas, where a

    of massive ramparts, a series of gates, beautifully designed gates, and cobbled paths. The
