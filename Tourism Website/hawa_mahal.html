            <p style="font-size: medium;" >             The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. Built from red 
             and pink sandstone, it is on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the 
             Zenana, or women's chambers.

             Hawa Mahal is known as the “palace of winds“. Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh built 
             it palace in 1799. Hawa Mahal is considered to be unique as it hasmany small windows 
             and balconies that seem like a honeycomb.
                
             The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh,grandson of 
             Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the founder of the city of Jhunjhunu in the state of Rajasthan. 
             He was so inspired by theunique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand 
             andhistorical palace.</p>

            <h3>Architecture</h3>
        <pre>
            <p>    This palace is a five-storey pyramidal shaped monument that rises to about 50 feet (15 m).
    The top three floors of the structure have the width of a single room, while the first
    and second floors have patios in front of them. The front elevation, as seen from the street,
    is like a honeycomb with small portholes. Each porthole has miniature windows and carved
    sandstone grills, finials and domes. It gives the appearance of a mass of semi-octagonal bays,
    giving the monument its unique façade. The inner face on the back side of the building
    consists of chambers built with pillars and corridors with minimal ornamentation, and
    reach up to the top floor. The interior of the palace has been described as 
    "having rooms of different coloured marbles, relieved by inlaid panels or gilding,
    while fountains adorn the centre of the courtyard".

    Lal Chand Ustad was the architect. Built-in red and pink coloured sandstone, in keeping 
    with the décor of the other monuments in the city.
