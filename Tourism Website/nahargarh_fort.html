            <p style="font-size: medium;">             Nahargarh Fort, perched on the rugged ridge of the Aravalli Hills, overlooks the Pink City
             of Jaipur in Rajasthan, India. The fort was originally named Sudarshangarh, but it later 
             became known as Nahargarh, which means 'abode of tigers'. 

             Built in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur, the fort was primarily 
             constructed as a retreat. Over the years, Nahargarh Fort has been a witness to many historical 
             events, including the treaties with the Marathas in the 18th century.

             Nahargarh Fort offers a panoramic view of Jaipur and provides a stunning backdrop when viewed 
             from the city. Its scenic location and historical significance make it a popular tourist destination.
